## 2. Hemisphere Light Bulb â€“ Intensity Analysis & Projection

### Problem Summary
We analyze a factoryâ€™s production of hemisphere-shaped light bulbs with a specified intensity pattern:
- Shape: Hemisphere of radius $R$
- Intensity:  
  $$I(\rho, \phi, z) = I_{\text{max}} \cdot z \quad\text{where}\quad z = R \cos(\theta)$$
  in spherical coordinates.

### Key Tasks
- **2-a:** Analytical calculation of the mean surface intensity (surface integration, not volume).
- **2-b:** Physical interpretation of the intensity distribution & impact of $I_{\text{max}}$ choice.
- **2-c:** Generate a **512Ã—512** px top-view projection of the ideal hemisphere.
- **2-d:** Mean intensity of the projected circle and relation to 2-a.
- **2-e / 2-f:** Impact of embedding in a square frame (zero padding) on mean intensity.

**Deliverables**:  
âœ” Mathematical derivations  
âœ” Python/MATLAB scripts  
âœ” Generated images & numerical results

## 3. Pixel Intensity Calibration Issues

### Context
A top-down camera captures the hemisphereâ€™s projection. The imaging setup fixes the top pointâ€™s distance to the lens at `2R`. Four faulty captures are provided.

### Key Tasks
- **3-a â†’ 3-d:** Identify defects in each given image, apply correction methods from **Section 3.2** of the textbook, and compute corrected mean intensities.
- Compare post-correction mean intensity with the ideal value from **2-f**.

**Techniques Used**:
- Illumination correction  
- Gamma adjustment  
- Intensity normalization

## 4. Watermark Logo Enhancement

### Task
Enhance a barely visible watermark on the hemisphere surface for marketing purposes.

**Approach**:
- Start with **histogram equalization**.
- Improve visibility using **advanced contrast enhancement** beyond naive equalization.

**Deliverables**: Enhanced image with documented algorithm design.

## 5. Linear Spatial Smoothing

### Task
Reduce strong noise in captured images.

**Steps**:
- **5-a:** Compare noisy vs. ideal image mean intensities.
- **5-b:** Apply box filters (sizes: 9, 25, 49, 81).
- **5-c:** Compute **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** for each kernel.
- **5-d:** Incrementally vary box filter size from `3Ã—3` to `127Ã—127` (odd numbers only), plot MSE vs. $k$.
- **5-e:** Repeat with Gaussian low-pass filters ($\sigma=5$), compare with box filter.
- **5-f:** 2D MSE analysis over both $k$ and $\sigma$.

**Outputs**:
- Filtered images for each $k$  
- MSE plots  
- Optimal filter parameters

## 6. Separable Kernels

**Objective**: Compare runtime and output quality between:
- 2D Gaussian filtering
- Two-pass separable 1D Gaussian filtering

**Deliverables**:
- Execution time benchmark  
- Quality comparison vs. Section 5 results  

---

## 7. Modality & Multi-Modal QC

### Concept
Visual inspection alone may fail for QC. We integrate **ultrasonic scanning** for structural verification.

**Tasks**:
- **7-a / 7-b:** Discuss shape verification with/without intensity correctness.
- **7-c:** Generate a **512Ã—512** px ideal target ultrasonic map from noisy sensor data.
- **7-d:** Perform full 2D MSE parameter search (as in 5-f) for denoising.

**Techniques Used**:
- Physics-based normalization  
- Gaussian smoothing parameter sweep
