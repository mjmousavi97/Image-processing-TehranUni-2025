# 📘 Digital Image Processing – Homework 1

This repository contains solutions to the **first assignment** of the *Digital Image Processing* course, implemented in **MATLAB**. The homework covers fundamental concepts such as image I/O, grayscale conversion, geometric transformations, intensity quantization, logical operations, local averaging, interpolation methods, and bit-plane manipulation.

## 🧠 Problems Overview

### ✅ Q1 – Basic Image Operations

- Load `lenna_rgb.png` and display it.
- Convert it to grayscale and double format.
- Save the result as `.jpg`.
- Resize the image with different scales (×5, ×½, ×¼) and visualize resolution loss.
- Plot the intensity values of the 150th scan line (similar to textbook Figure 2.16).

📁 Input: `lenna_rgb.png`  
📁 Output: `results/Q1_*.png`

---

### ✅ Q2 – Intensity Level Reduction

- Load `skull.tif`.
- Display versions with 64, 16, 4, and 2 intensity levels (quantization).
- Discuss visual effects of reducing intensity resolution.

📁 Input: `skull.tif`  
📁 Output: `results/Q2_*.png`

---

### ✅ Q3 – Affine Geometric Transformations

Apply the following transformations **without using MATLAB built-in functions** like `imresize`, `imrotate`, etc.:

- **Scaling**
- **Rotation**
- **Translation**
- **Shear**

Use affine transformation matrices (based on textbook Table 2.2) and custom implementations.

📁 Input: `T.tif`  
📁 Output: `results/Q3_*.png`

---

### ✅ Q4 – Logical Operations on Binary Images

- Create two binary images with rectangles of amplitude 1 at specific positions.
- Implement custom functions for:
  - `NOT`
  - `AND`
  - `OR`
  - `AND-NOT`
  - `XOR`
- Visualize results as shown in textbook Figure 2.33.

📁 Output: `results/Q4_*.png`

---

### ✅ Q5 – Local Averaging (Smoothing)

- Implement a 2D average filter manually (no `conv2`, etc.).
- Apply to `lenna.png` using filter sizes: 3×3, 7×7, 11×11, 23×23.
- Compare the degree of blurring.

📁 Input: `lenna.png`  
📁 Output: `results/Q5_*.png`

---

### ✅ Q6 – Interpolation Comparison

- Load `watch.tif`.
- Shrink the image by factor of 5 and zoom back to original size using:
  - Nearest neighbor
  - Bilinear
  - Bicubic
- Compare quality and detail preservation.

📁 Input: `watch.tif`  
📁 Output: `results/Q6_*.png`

---

### ✅ Q7 – Bit Manipulation & Image Subtraction

a) **Bit-Plane Slicing**  
- Load `WashingtonDC.tif` and zero-out the 6th bit of each pixel.  
- Compare with original and visualize the difference.

b) **Medical Image Subtraction**  
- Load `angiography_mask.tif` and `angiography_live.tif`.  
- Subtract and enhance visualization by displaying the **negative** of the difference image.

📁 Input: `WashingtonDC.tif`, `angiography_*.tif`  
📁 Output: `results/Q7_*.png`

---

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Open MATLAB.
2. Set the current folder to the `src/utils` directory.
3. Run each script separately using:

```matlab
run('Q1.m')  % or Q2.m, ..., Q7.m
```

4. Output images are automatically saved in the `results` directory in `.png` format.
