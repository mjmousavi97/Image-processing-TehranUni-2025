## üß† Problems Overview

### ‚úÖ Q2 ‚Äì Fourier Transform Analysis

- Load `woman.tif` and `parrot.tif`.
- Compute **Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)** using `fft2`.
- Calculate and visualize **magnitude and phase spectra**.
- Reconstruct images using:
  - Only phase information.
  - Spectrum and phase from another image.
  - Mixed spectrum and phase.
- Analyze the effect of **scaling (1.5√ó)** and **spatial shifts (5% in X, Y, XY)** on the Fourier representation.
- Replace **lower-half frequency components** of one image with another and observe results.


---

### ‚úÖ Q3 ‚Äì Exploring Filter Types

- Implement a **custom MATLAB filter function** supporting:
  - Filter type: Low-Pass (LPF) / High-Pass (HPF)
  - Kernel type: Ideal / Butterworth / Gaussian
  - Specific filter parameters
- Load `char.tif` and apply:
  - Ideal LPF and HPF (D‚ÇÄ = 15, 30, 50, 150, 400)
  - Butterworth filter (order = 2)
  - Gaussian filter
- Compare filtered images and their **frequency responses**.


---

### ‚úÖ Q4 ‚Äì High-Frequency Emphasis Filtering

- Load `chest.tif`.
- Apply **high-frequency emphasis filtering** to enhance X-ray images.
- Adjust intensity levels to improve contrast and visualize results.


---

### ‚úÖ Q5 ‚Äì Moir√© Pattern Removal

- Load `carmoire.tif` and inspect its **frequency spectrum**.
- Design and apply **notch filters** to remove moir√© patterns.
- Compare original and filtered images in both spatial and frequency domains.


---

### ‚úÖ Q6 ‚Äì Laplacian Filtering

- Load `bld.tif`.
- Apply the **Laplacian kernel** in the spatial domain:

```
-1  -1  -1
-1   8  -1
-1  -1  -1
```

- Compute and plot its **frequency response**.
- Apply the same filter in the **frequency domain**.
- Compare results and discuss differences.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run

1. Open MATLAB.
2. Set the current folder to the corresponding `src/Q*` directory.
3. Run the main script for each question.

```matlab
run('main.m')  % for Q2, Q3, ..., Q6
```

4. Output images are saved in the same folder as the scripts by default.
