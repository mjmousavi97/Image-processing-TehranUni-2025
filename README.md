## 📄 Description

This repository contains the homework assignments for the **Digital Image Processing** course, taken during **Spring 1404 (Spring 2025)** at the **Faculty of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Tehran**.

## 📚 About the Course


This is an intensive and technical course based on the authoritative textbook "Digital Image Processing" by Gonzalez and Woods, 4th Edition. The course is organized into ten structured modules, each aligned with a major topic from the book. Students are expected to implement foundational algorithms from scratch, interpret image behavior through visual outputs, and develop a deep conceptual understanding of digital image processing systems.
Due to the hands-on nature of this course, the implementation prioritizes **conceptual understanding** over strict coding best practices. However, the code will be **refactored and improved** after the semester.

💻 Approximately half of the assignments are implemented in MATLAB and the other half in Python, depending on the nature of the problem and computational convenience.

All implementations emphasize educational clarity over code optimization. In most cases, high-level built-in functions are avoided to encourage algorithmic thinking. Finalized codebases will be revised and polished after the semester ends.

## ✅ Homework Status

| Homework | Status   | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| **DIP-HW1**  | ✅ Completed | Basic image I/O, grayscale conversion, data type casting, image resizing, scan-line plotting, intensity quantization, custom affine transforms, binary image logic, local averaging filters, image interpolation comparison, bit-plane slicing, and medical image subtraction. Skills gained include: <br>➤ Reading/writing image data <br>➤ Custom matrix transformations <br>➤ Visualization and plotting <br>➤ Logical operations <br>➤ Noise reduction techniques <br>➤ Working with medical masks and subtraction methods. |
| **DIP-HW2**  | ⏳ Pending | *(To be added after completion)* |



🔧 The remaining assignments will be gradually reviewed, completed, and refined as the course progresses and after its conclusion.

## 🧠 Implementation Notes


- Some implementations are written from scratch (no built-in functions), in alignment with educational goals.
- The repository structure includes clearly separated folders for `data`, `src`, `results`, and `docs`.
