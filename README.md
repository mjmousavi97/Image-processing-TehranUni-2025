# Digital Image Processing – Homework Assignments
![image](image-processing.png)

## Description
This repository contains the homework assignments for the **Digital Image Processing** course, which I am currently taking in the Faculty of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Tehran during Spring 1404 (Spring 2025).

> ⚠️ Note: Some assignments are not yet completed and will be added later.

## 📚 About the Course

This is an intensive and demanding course, and as such, the code implementations may not always be perfectly clean or optimized. Some solutions may contain mistakes or require improvement.

## 🧠 Implementation Notes

- Assignments are implemented using both **MATLAB** and **Python**, depending on the nature of the task and convenience.
- Due to time constraints during the semester, some code may lack proper documentation, structure, or best practices.
- After completing the course, I plan to revisit the assignments to review, refactor, and correct the code where needed.
